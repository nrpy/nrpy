"""
C function registration for a nearest-sampled diagnostics dispatcher.

This module provides a single function, register_CFunction_diagnostics_nearest(), which
constructs and registers the C function diagnostics_nearest(). The generated C routine
invokes specialized helpers to emit nearest-sampled diagnostics:
  - 0D: diagnostics_nearest_grid_center() samples the point nearest the grid center.
  - 1D: diagnostics_nearest_1d_y_and_z_axes() samples along the lines nearest the y and z axes.
  - 2D: diagnostics_nearest_2d_xy_and_yz_planes() samples across the planes nearest the xy and yz planes.

A single USER-EDIT block appears before the per-grid loop. In that block, users select
which_gfs arrays (by enum) for each dimensionality; these selections apply to all grids.
The third C parameter, gridfuncs_diags[grid], must point to caller-owned REAL diagnostic
gridfunctions that serve as the sampling source.

During code generation:
  - The routine is placed under the diagnostics/ subdirectory.
  - It includes the headers BHaH_defines.h, BHaH_function_prototypes.h, and diagnostic_gfs.h.

At runtime, diagnostics_nearest() loops over all grids and calls the helper routines that handle
coordinate selection, sampling, and file I/O for each dimensionality. This dispatcher allocates
no memory and frees none; ownership remains with the caller.

 * @brief Dispatch nearest-sampled diagnostics by invoking specialized helper routines for 0D, 1D, and 2D outputs.
 *
 * The diagnostics_nearest() dispatcher coordinates sampling of diagnostic gridfunction data from caller-provided
 * buffers and delegates output to three helper functions:
 *   - diagnostics_nearest_grid_center(): emits 0D diagnostics at the index triplet nearest the physical center.
 *   - diagnostics_nearest_1d_y_and_z_axes(): emits 1D diagnostics along lines nearest the y and z axes.
 *   - diagnostics_nearest_2d_xy_and_yz_planes(): emits 2D diagnostics across planes nearest the xy and yz planes.
 *
 * A single USER-EDIT block appears before the per-grid loop. In that block, users select which_gfs arrays (by enum)
 * for each dimensionality. These selections are applied uniformly to all grids. The dispatcher itself performs no
 * memory allocation or deallocation; all buffers are owned by the caller. Helper routines may perform file I/O.
 *
 * @param[in] commondata
 *   Pointer to shared simulation metadata and runtime context, including NUMGRIDS and iteration/time information.
 *
 * @param[in] griddata
 *   Pointer to an array of per-grid data structures. For grid index "grid", griddata[grid] provides parameters,
 *   coordinates, and strides required by the diagnostics helper routines.
 *
 * @param[in] gridfuncs_diags
 *   Array of length MAXNUMGRIDS. For each grid index "grid", gridfuncs_diags[grid] must point to caller-owned
 *   REAL diagnostic gridfunction data that serve as the sampling source.
 *
 * @pre
 *   - For each active grid, gridfuncs_diags[grid] is non-null and points to valid diagnostic data.
 *   - which_gfs indices selected in the USER-EDIT block map to valid diagnostic gridfunctions.
 *   - Helper symbols diagnostics_nearest_grid_center(), diagnostics_nearest_1d_y_and_z_axes(), and
 *     diagnostics_nearest_2d_xy_and_yz_planes() are available at link time.
 *
 * @post
 *   - For each grid, helper routines may emit 0D, 1D (y and z), and 2D (xy and yz) diagnostic outputs.
 *   - No memory is allocated or freed by this dispatcher.
 *
 * @return void
 *
 * @note The USER-EDIT block is for selecting which diagnostic gridfunctions to sample. Keep it concise and avoid
 *       per-grid logic there, as the dispatcher handles iteration over grids.
